# The Tasks Directory
This directory consists of tasks called by the [makefile](https://github.com/imaginate/log-ocd/blob/master/make.js). Each script in this directory must export one [Task object](https://github.com/imaginate/log-ocd/blob/master/helpers/task.js) with at least one method. See the [makefile documentation](https://github.com/imaginate/log-ocd/blob/master/docs/makefile.md) for more details about all of the tasks and how to use them.
