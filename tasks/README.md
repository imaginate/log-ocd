# The Tasks Directory
This directory consists of makefile tasks called by the [project makefile](https://github.com/imaginate/log-ocd/blob/master/make.js). Each script must export one [Task object](https://github.com/imaginate/log-ocd/blob/master/helpers/task.js) with at least one method. See the [makefile](https://github.com/imaginate/log-ocd/blob/master/make.js) for instructions on using the tasks.
